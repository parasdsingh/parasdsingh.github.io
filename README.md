# Terminal CV - Parasdeep Singh

> A professional DevOps engineer's CV crafted with terminal aesthetics and pure web technologies.

A sophisticated, terminal-themed web CV that combines authentic Unix command-line aesthetics with modern responsive design principles. Built entirely with pure HTML and CSS - no frameworks, no JavaScript, no compromises.

## ✨ Design Philosophy

**"Zen meets DevOps"** - This CV embodies the philosophy of a DevOps professional who appreciates both simplicity and technical excellence. Every element is carefully crafted to reflect the mindset of someone who lives and breathes the terminal.

### Core Principles
